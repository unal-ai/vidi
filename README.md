# [Vidi2: Large Multimodal Models for Video Understanding and Creation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.19529)

Homepage: https://bytedance.github.io/vidi-website/

> We introduce Vidi, a family of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for a wide range of video understanding and editing (VUE) scenarios. The first release focuses on temporal retrieval (TR), i.e., identifying the time ranges in input videos corresponding to a given text query. The second release evolves toward a foundation model with state-of-the-art spatio-temporal grounding (STG) and temporal retrieval capability while maintaining basic open-ended video QA performance.

## Release

<!-- - [ ] Vidi2 release, tech report and homepage update
- [ ] New benchmarks release with evaluation code
- [ ] Vidi-7B Weight and inference code
- [ ] Demo update with new capability
- [ ] Demo update to latest checkpoint -->


## Demo
1. Select a mode from ["Highlight", "VQA", "Retrieval", "Grounding"] on the segmented button. Please use English query for the best experience.

- "Highlight": No input query needed. Directly output a set of highlight clips with title.

- "VQA": Input a question/instruction about the video. The model will answer the question.

- "Retrieval": Input a text query to be searched. The model will find the clips corresponding to text query.

- "Grounding": Input a text query indicating the object to be searched. The model will find the clips corresponding to text query with bounding boxes on the object.


2. Click "Upload" button and select a video local file (mp4 format). Make sure the video is not corrupted, and the resolution is not too high. 480p is recommended for fast uploading and decoding.
2. After the video is uploaded, wait till the uploading is finished and the video is ready to play in the box.
3. Enter the text query if needed. Click the "Send" button.
4. Wait till the result clips show in the chat box. This could take several minutes for long video.

## Installation

### Option 1: Conda Environment (Recommended)

For clean devices, we recommend using Miniconda/Conda for environment setup:

```bash
# If conda is not installed, the script will install Miniconda automatically
./setup_conda.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
# Create conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate environment
conda activate vidi

# Install flash-attention (optional, requires CUDA)
pip install flash-attn==2.6.3 --no-build-isolation
```

### Option 2: Pip Installation

Run the [install.sh](install.sh) for pip-based installation.



## Evaluation (VUE-STG)

We release the video ids, ground-truth annotation and evaluation results in csv files. Follow the instruction in [VUE_STG/README.md](VUE_STG/README.md) to conduct evaluation.
```
cd VUE_STG
python3 evaluate.py
```

To evaluate your own model:
1. First download the videos based on the ids in ["VUE_STG/vue-stg-benchmark/video.csv"](VUE_STG/vue-stg-benchmark/video.csv) from Youtube (e.g., [yt-dlp
](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)). 
2. Generate the result following the format in [VUE_STG/results/vidi2/tubes.csv](VUE_STG/results/vidi2/tubes.csv). Run evaluation script.


## Evaluation (VUE-TR-V2)
We release the ground-truth annotation and evaluation results in 5 json files. Run the script for a standalone evaluation:
```
cd VUE_TR_V2
python3 -u qa_eval.py --pred_path results_Vidi.json
```
The result figures will be saved in the output folder ('./results' by default)
.

<img src="VUE_TR_V2/results/IoU_radar_plot.png" width="300"/> <img src="VUE_TR_V2/results/overall_IoU_plot.png" width="377"/> 

For evaluation of new models, first download the videos based on the ids in [VUE_TR_V2/video_id.txt](VUE_TR_V2/video_id.txt) from Youtube (e.g., [yt-dlp
](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)). Then run inference and save the results in the following format:
```
[
    {
        "query_id": 0,
        "video_id": "6Qv-LrXJjSM",
        "duration": 3884.049,
        "query": "The slide showcases Taco Bell's purple ang pow for Chinese New Year, while a woman explains that purple symbolizes royalty in the Chinese tradition.",
        "answer": [
            [
                913.1399199,
                953.5340295
            ]
        ],
        "task": "temporal_retrieval"
    },
    ...
]
```

You may find the instruction and data for the previous version (VUE-TR) [here](VUE_TR/README.md).


## Model and Inference
We release the 7B model weight for reproduction of Vidi results in 2025/04/15 tech report. 

First download the checkpoint from [https://huggingface.co/bytedance-research/Vidi-7B](https://huggingface.co/bytedance-research/Vidi-7B).

Then run [install.sh](Vidi_7B/install.sh) in "./Vidi_7B":
```
cd Vidi_7B
bash install.sh
```

For a given video (e.g., [example_video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PZXUmTwUivFV_0nRhAnVR4LO9N9AAA1e/view?usp=sharing)) and text query (e.g., slicing onion), run the following command to get the results:

```
python3 -u inference.py --video-path [video path] --query [query] --model-path [model path]
``` 

## Storyline-based Video Creation

Vidi's temporal retrieval and grounding capabilities can be leveraged for storyline-based video creation (smart video clipping). This feature allows you to:

- **Create highlight reels** from long-form videos
- **Extract specific storyline segments** based on natural language descriptions
- **Build narrative-driven clips** by querying for multiple scenes

For detailed technical documentation, see the [Storyline Video Creation Report](docs/STORYLINE_VIDEO_CREATION_REPORT.md).

### Quick Example

```python
# Example: Extract clips matching a storyline
from Vidi_7B.model.builder import load_pretrained_model

# Load model
model, tokenizer, image_processor, audio_processor = load_pretrained_model("path/to/vidi-7b")

# Define storyline segments
storyline = [
    "opening scene with introduction",
    "main action sequence", 
    "conclusion and closing remarks"
]

# Query each segment using the temporal retrieval functionality
# See docs/STORYLINE_VIDEO_CREATION_REPORT.md for complete implementation
```
